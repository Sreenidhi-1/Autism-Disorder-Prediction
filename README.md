# Autism-Disorder-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting autism using various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The project also utilizes LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret and understand feature contributions to predictions.


### Models

The following machine learning models are implemented in the project:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree

### LIME Explanations

LIME is used to provide local interpretability for model predictions. The key features contributing to each prediction are analyzed and visualized.

### Features

The code is organized and documented for clarity. Key documentation includes:
- Model implementation details
- Data preprocessing steps
- LIME explanation integration
- Testing procedures

## Results and Visualization

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are compared across different models. Visualizations are created to present the results effectively.
